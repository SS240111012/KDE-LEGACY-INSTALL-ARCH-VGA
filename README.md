# KDE-LEGACY-INSTALL-ARCH-VGA
A blog related to me installing / re - installing Arch linux KDE for My legacy system .



In this process I'll be installing Arch KDE on my legacy System ;

### Specs :
- ** CPU ** : Intel Pentium G3320@
- ** Ram ** : DDr3 1333 ghz 2+2GB ram
- ** GPU ** : Intel Integrated @
- ** Monitor ** : Samsung Syncmaster 92nw -- VGA

### Process :
so I have installed arch currenlty (while writing this blog) But I wanted to re install Arch since my KDE arch was very very slow and I wanted to do it via the Manual Arch install so ; Hence I am writing this blog so that I can use it for my self and so on like that .

First I copied my grub here on the github so I can use it later on ;

Now you do want to backup your exisiting files to a new Device or sort if they are important to you .
Now lets DO the manual Arch install :D

### Source for Manual Arch install :
Reminder that I am doing MANUAL ARCH INSTALL NOT '''Archinstall''' ; so For you to do that kindly check out the arch wiki.
